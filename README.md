# OpenBLT Bootloader

OpenBLT is an open source bootloader for STM32, XMC, HCS12 and other 
microcontroller targets.

OpenBLT enables you and your customers to update the firmware on your
microcontroller based product. A major benefit of OpenBLT being open source
is that you can customize and tweak the bootloader to your specific needs.

OpenBLT can be ported to any 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit microcontroller and 
currently runs on microcontrollers with an ARM Cortex-M, Infineon Tricore, and
Freescale HCS12 core. It is most popular on 

By default, it supports communication interfaces such as: RS232, CAN, USB, 
TCP/IP and it ships with the easy-to-use MicroBoot PC tool for initiating and
monitoring the firmware update. Performing firmware updates directly from an
SD-card is also supported.
